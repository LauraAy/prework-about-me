      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm a rare book librarian who has been managing digital projects to share historical objects with the world. Now I'm embarking on a new path as a coder who can make beautiful applications! </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I grew up in Southern California and spent my college years at UCSB.  I spent 9 years in Chicago getting my PhD in literature and my MLIS, teaching, and starting my library career at the amazing <a href="https://www.newberry.org/">Newberry Library</a>.  Then I spent 5 years working in Philadelphia at the Penn Libraries <a href="https://www.library.upenn.edu/kislak">Kislak Center for Special Collections, Rare Books and Manuscripts.</a>  Now I'm back home in So Cal and loving it!</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love to swim, knit, play the piano, do yoga, read...lots more! </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I would love to work as a development consultant on interesting academic projects, using my humanities background and my new technical skills.   </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Huntington Beach</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I've been doing a little coding in my project management work in the library field and think it's fascinating work that there's also a real demand for, especially combined with my academic knowledge and experience</p>
